# Cloud Functions

I initially deployed the first CloudFunction by just clicking through the UI and following
this Quickstart guide [](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/quickstart-nodejs).
It was actually quite easy to get this up and running.

After the successful deployment I adopted the external LoadBalancer to accept load via
"https://hackathon.senacor.sebastianneb.de/function".
